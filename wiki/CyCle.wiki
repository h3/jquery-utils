The jQuery Cycle Plugin is a lightweight slideshow plugin. Its implementation is based on the [http://medienfreunde.com/lab/innerfade/ InnerFade Plugin] by Torsten Baldes, the [http://www.matto1990.com/web-design/jquery-plugins/simple-jquery-slideshow/ Slideshow Plugin] by Matt Oakes, and the [http://www.benjaminsterling.com/experiments/jqShuffle/ jqShuffle Plugin] by Benjamin Sterling. It supports pause-on-hover, auto-stop, auto-fit, before/after callbacks, click triggers and many transition effects. It also supports, but does not require, the [http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/metadata/jquery.metadata.js Metadata Plugin] and the [http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery.easing.php Easing Plugin].

pause-on-hover, auto-stop, auto-fit, before/after callbacks, click triggers and many transition effects. It also supports, but does not require, the Metadata Plugin and the Easing Plugin.
