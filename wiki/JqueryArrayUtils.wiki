== Introduction ==

Provide additional functional method to work with array. This library is largely inspired by the [http://www.prototypejs.org/api/enumerable enumerables] concept in the [http://www.prototypejs.org/ Prototype Javascript Library].

== Methods ==

|| *Method* || *Returns* || *Descriptions* ||
|| `$.all` || `boolean` || Determines whether all the elements are boolean-equivalent to true, either directly or through computation by the provided iterator ||
|| `$.any` || `boolean` || Determines whether at least one element is boolean-equivalent to true, either directly or through computation by the provided iterator ||
|| `$.detect` || `mixed` || Finds the first element for which the iterator returns true. ||
|| `$.collect` || `array` || Returns all the elements for which the iterator returned true. ||
|| `$.pluck` || `array` || Fetch the same property for all the elements and returns the property values. ||
|| `$.zip` || `array` || Zips together 2 sequences, providing an array of tuples. Each tuple contains one value per original sequence. Tuples can be converted to something else by applying the optional iterator on them. ||
