#sidebar SideNav

= jquery.anchorhandler.js = 

This jQuery plugin allow to use regular expressions to attach events on url hanchor.. it's less complicated and more useful than it sounds :)

It's a clever and neat way to handle custom URLs that I borrowed from django's clever [http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/url_dispatch/ URL dispatcher].

== Example ==

{{{

$.anchorHandler
    .add(/\#show\-something/,   function(){ /* ..*/  })
    .add(/\#trigger\-event/,    someEvent)
    .add(/\#/,                  smoothScrollToLink);

}}}

Note: the add method also accept arrays.
