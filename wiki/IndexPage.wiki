jQuery utils is a set of jQuery plugins I made or borrowed that I often reuse in my projects, so I created this project in hope it might serve somebody back. jQuery is such a great free open source project, I feel that giving my work back to the community is the less I could do.

Don't hesitate to submit comments, bugs or patches.
